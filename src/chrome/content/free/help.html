The add-on allows to stick notes to emails. The notes don't affect the email in any way. 
They are stored locally on your hard drive (or on a centralized server in the Multi-User edition of
the add-on).<br>
<br>
Actions you may perform:
<ul>
<li> Add note to selected email message.</li>
<li> Edit note.</li>
<li> Delete note.</li>
<li> Set/Change note status</li>
<li> Search for notes containing given text.</li>
<li> Add the same note to multiple emails.</li>
<li> Tag messages which have notes.</li>
</ul>

All actions are accessible through hotkeys, which are customizable. Status icons are also customizable.
